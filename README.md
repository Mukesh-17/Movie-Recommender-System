# Movie-Recommender-System
A content based 'Movie Recommendation System' that  attributes such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make suggestions for the users. The idea behind this type of recommendation system is that if a person enjoyed one movie or show, he or she might enjoy another comparable movie or show.
Every year thousands of movies are released all around the world.
Showing movie recommendations is necessary so that the user does not waste time looking for stuff that he or she might enjoy.
So, I have  tried to build a content based ‘Movie Recommender System’  which suggests popular movies to the user .
A content-based recommendation help the users get personalized suggestions for their input unlike collaborative filtering.
What is Content based recommendation?
A content based ‘Movie Recommender System’ uses attributes such as genre,director,description,actors,etc. for movies, to make suggestions for the users.

The intuition behind this sort of recommendation system is that if a user liked a particular movie,he or she might like a movie similar to it.

What is Cosine Similarity?
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar two items are.

Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The output value ranges from 0–1.

0 means no similarity, where as 1 means that both the items are 100% similar.
