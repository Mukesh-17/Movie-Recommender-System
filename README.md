# Movie-Recommender-System
A content based 'Movie Recommendation System' that  attributes such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make suggestions for the users. The idea behind this type of recommendation system is that if a person enjoyed one movie or show, he or she might enjoy another comparable movie or show.
Every year thousands of movies are released all around the world.
Showing movie recommendations is necessary so that the user does not waste time looking for stuff that he or she might enjoy.
So, I have  tried to build a content based ‘Movie Recommender System’  which suggests popular movies to the user .
A content-based recommendation help the users get personalized suggestions for their input unlike collaborative filtering.
